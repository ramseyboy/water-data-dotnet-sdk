## Water Data SDK for .NET

.Net 6 SDK for pulling data from the USGS NWIS (National Water Information System) and the WQP (Water Quality Data Portal) datasets for use in dotnet applications.

This is very much a work in progress.

Data Sources:
1. NWIS - https://waterservices.usgs.gov
2. WQP - http://waterqualitydata.us
